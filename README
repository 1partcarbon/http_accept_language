HttpAcceptLanguage
==================

A small effort in making a plugin which helps you detect the users prefered language, as sent by the HTTP header.

It is sorted as much as possible by the priority given.

Example
=======

class SomeController < ApplicationController
  def some_action
    request.user_preferred_language
    # [ 'nl-nl', 'nl-be', 'nl', 'en-us', 'en' ]
  end
end
